# **About our Project**
The exponential growth of digital content has made it increasingly difficult for users to discover relevant articles tailored to their interests. Our project aims to develop a content-based recommendation system that clusters and suggests relevant articles without relying on predefined labels. This system will enhance user engagement by providing personalized reading recommendations, ensuring that high-quality content reaches the right audience, and increasing retention rates on news platforms.

# **Business Relevance:**
Traditional recommendation systems, based on simple keywords or broad demographic data end up missing the mark to grasp what the readers actually care about, which leads to lower  engagement rate, high bounce rates and major revenue loss from ads. For CNNs Daily Mail thousands of articles published everyday, it's easy for great content to be buried. That’s where our project comes in. Our AI-driven system will enhance:
- Improve **user engagement** by delivering personalized recommendations leading to longer session durations, lower bounce rates, and increased content consumption.
- Help publishers **identify emerging trends** and repurpose relevant articles.
- **Increase ad revenue** through targeted content delivery, improving ROI for advertisers and boosting programmatic ad revenue.
- **Scale efficiently** to handle vast amounts of news data in real time and allowing them to focus on higher-value editorial strategies.
  
**Real-World Applications**: The insights from our project have multiple business applications:
**News Media:** Personalized article recommendations to increase user dwell time.
E-Commerce & Marketing: Content recommendations based on user interest.
Academic Research: Automated categorization of research papers for better discoverability.

#**Problem Statement**
In today’s fast paced, reel-scrolling digital world, keeping readers engaged is a major challenge for media companies. People are constantly bombarded with news, and if they don’t find content that truly interests them, they quickly lose interest and move on. The main objective of our project is to create an intelligent recommendation system for news articles that enhances content discoverability without requiring manual categorization. Our specific objectives include:
- Identifying patterns in large-scale unstructured text data.
- Implementing NLP techniques to extract meaningful insights.
- Applying unsupervised learning methods such as topic modeling and document similarity heuristics.
- Developing a content-based recommender system to improve user engagement.
This system will enhance user engagement, improve content discovery, and provide a seamless reading experience by reducing the effort required to find relevant articles. The recommender will be designed for news platforms, academic journals, or online media, ensuring that users receive high-quality, contextually relevant content suggestions.
